                    <x-li-arrow>As a working research institute, we are limited in how many
                        visitor groups we can host each year, and in the size of those groups. We
                        therefore reserve the right to decline a visit request if it is not relevant to
                        our mission or if we are unable to provide staff members to host.</x-li-arrow>
                        <x-li-arrow>Both our main sites occasionally run open days when multiple
                            groups may visit and meet a range of experts. Details are publicised in advance.
                            If an open day is planned, you may be asked to plan your visit to coincide with
                            that day. </x-li-arrow>
                        <x-li-arrow>For outdoor visits, you can expect to walk over rough
                            farmland. If anyone in your party has mobility issues, please notify us in
                            advance. Please also bring suitable outdoor clothing.</x-li-arrow>
                        <x-li-arrow>For some visitors, there may be a charge to cover room hire
                            and staff time. Once the form below has been submitted, we will send you
                            notification if a charge is to be levied.</x-li-arrow>

                <p  class="mt-3">Our scientists are always happy to share their expertise, but
                    cannot necessarily offer specific solutions to day-to-day farming challenges as
                    our strategic research often needs further development before it can deliver
                    successful market-based solutions. </p>
